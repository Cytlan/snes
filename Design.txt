Summary
-------
Sci-fi city where people are getting their bodies modified with technology left and right. A criminal gang has launched a virus after their demands were not taken seriously and not met. This virus is infecting people which these body modification, effectively turning them into zombies attacking anyone at sight.
A suggested solution has been to launch a city-wide EMP that would disable all electronics and effectively stop the virus and save everyone. However, it’s argued that this would be an even worse disaster for the city, as all city infrastructure would also go offline causing total chaos. Instead they propose the development of an anti-virus, but there’s no telling how quickly this can be developed, or if it will even be possible at all.
